# Make-Cities-Greener
This project is an indivisual project.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to understand bike riders behaviour, station traffic and popular routes in order to help bike management and operation to improve bike sharing system efficiency and accessibility, so more and more people cycling indtead of driving, our city become greener.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Googlemaps with Google Distance Matrix API
* Tableau 

## Project Description
In this project, I am going to analyze Oslo City Bike historical tripdata from 2019/01 to 2021/08. The primary goal is to understand riders behavior, usage of stations and existing rouotes by answering following questions:
* üò∑ How have the riding changed since pandemic?
* üìÖ When do they ride? at different granularity levels of date, such as year, season, month, day and hour.
* üèûÔ∏è Where do riders go?
* üíº Map out the "rush hour" of different stations
* üìà What are the most popular cycling routes in Oslo?
* üö¥ How far do they go?
In addition, we want to find insights to encourage more people to ride bikes instead of driving cars. The idea could be to show people how efficient it is to ride a bike and how much carbon emission is saved if taking a bike instead of a car based on the historical data. So in this project, we will also look into:
* ‚ö°Ô∏è Compare the efficiency between cycling and driving?
* ‚ôªÔ∏è How much CO2 emission has cycling saved?

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- data visualization
- Interactive map viz.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [Oslo City Bike website](https://oslobysykkel.no/en/open-data/historical)  
3. Routes data `route_df` with distance/duration by driving from Google Distance Matrix API can be found this this repo also.
